    "# Creating a basic chat experience with kernel arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how you can build a simple chat bot by sending and updating the kernel arguments with your requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the Kernel Arguments object which in this demo functions similarly as a key-value store that you can use when running the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat history is local (i.e. in your computer's RAM) and not persisted anywhere beyond the life of this Jupyter session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future examples, we will show how to persist the chat history on disk so that you can bring it into your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chat scenario, as the user talks back and forth with the bot, the chat context gets populated with the history of the conversation. During each new run of the kernel, the kernel arguments and chat history can provide the AI with its variables' content.\n"
